# Buildspec syntax

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codebuild/latest/userguide/build-spec-ref.html

Buildspec files must be expressed in YAML format. If a command contains a character, or a string of characters, that is not supported by YAML, you must enclose the command in quotation marks (""). The following command is enclosed in quotation marks because a colon (:) followed by a space is not allowed in YAML. The quotation mark in the command is escaped (\").

```
"export PACKAGE_NAME=$(cat package.json | grep name | head -1 | awk -F: '{ print $2 }' | sed 's/[\",]//g')"
```

The buildspec has the following syntax:

```
